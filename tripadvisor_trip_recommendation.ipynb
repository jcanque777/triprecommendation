But it is so worth it!\\nI am mobility impaired. I thought the Acropolis would be one of places that would be off limits to me. We were smart enough to book the Viator full day Athens private tour, and our wonderful driver knew exactly where to take me and who to talk to. (There is a discount for disabled people and their one companion.) He took me as close as possible to the chair lift that goes to the elevator. Without that you are looking at what would for me have been an impossible climb up hundreds of rough uneven stone flights of steps. The lift is a platform that slowly ascends up the long stairway. Those stairs are shallow and doable if you can walk at all. When you get to the top of that you then are taken into an industrial cage elevator that ascends the vertical cliff. This elevator is NOT for the faint of heart; in fact I was asked in broken English if I had any heart problems. I am severely claustrophobic but this elevator, being an open gauge cage, did not bother me at all. It takes you in your chair slowly up the face of that cliff and when you roll out, facing the magnificent parthenon, and slowly roll past the 7 maidens of the temple, you will find you cannot catch your breath because of the spectacular scale and beauty before you. Pictures fail, words fail, nothing can prepare you for the spirit and aura of this place. The views are incredible- all of Athens, Lycabettus hill, churches and mosques, the entire Agora, Mars Hill, the far mountains, even the coast on a clear day. It was difficult to navigate up at the top- much of the terrain is very rough even for my sturdy chair. Even where you can navigate the chair, prepare to have your kidneys rattled. But I am so so so grateful to the extremely helpful and encouraging staff, my family, and my knowledgable driver for making this possible for me. It more than exceeded anything I could have imagined.\\nShow less\\nDate of experience: December 2019\\nAsk letsgomama about Acropolis\\n2  Thank letsgomama\\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\\nPotterUbik\\nBerlin, Germany\\n19763\\nReviewed 3 weeks ago\\nAfternoon is more relaxed\\nYou can buy tickets in advance but u still have to pick up ticket bought online.

Make sure to prearrange or ask for that special lift if you have a disabled person in your group as climbing the rock can be tough for some. Another thing to be aware of if you visit Acropolis in summer is that the temperatures are really high with no shelter as you are basically at the top of a huge rock so it would be wise to have an umbrella and a bottle of water with you!\\nShow less\\nDate of experience: May 2019\\nAsk 223yiannisk about Acropolis\\nThank 223yiannisk\\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\\nnadiaolson\\nMontenegro\\n11137\\nReviewed 3 weeks ago\\nMust See\\nYou cant be in Athens without visiting the Acropolis.

But it is so worth it!\\nI am mobility impaired. I thought the Acropolis would be one of places that would be off limits to me. We were smart enough to book the Viator full day Athens private tour, and our wonderful driver knew exactly where to take me and who to talk to. (There is a discount for disabled people and their one companion.) He took me as close as possible to the chair lift that goes to the elevator. Without that you are looking at what would for me have been an impossible climb up hundreds of rough uneven stone flights of steps. The lift is a platform that slowly ascends up the long stairway. Those stairs are shallow and doable if you can walk at all. When you get to the top of that you then are taken into an industrial cage elevator that ascends the vertical cliff. This elevator is NOT for the faint of heart; in fact I was asked in broken English if I had any heart problems. I am severely claustrophobic but this elevator, being an open gauge cage, did not bother me at all. It takes you in your chair slowly up the face of that cliff and when you roll out, facing the magnificent parthenon, and slowly roll past the 7 maidens of the temple, you will find you cannot catch your breath because of the spectacular scale and beauty before you. Pictures fail, words fail, nothing can prepare you for the spirit and aura of this place. The views are incredible- all of Athens, Lycabettus hill, churches and mosques, the entire Agora, Mars Hill, the far mountains, even the coast on a clear day. It was difficult to navigate up at the top- much of the terrain is very rough even for my sturdy chair. Even where you can navigate the chair, prepare to have your kidneys rattled. But I am so so so grateful to the extremely helpful and encouraging staff, my family, and my knowledgable driver for making this possible for me. It more than exceeded anything I could have imagined.\\nShow less\\nDate of experience: December 2019\\nAsk letsgomama about Acropolis\\n2  Thank letsgomama\\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\\nPotterUbik\\nBerlin, Germany\\n19763\\nReviewed 3 weeks ago\\nAfternoon is more relaxed\\nYou can buy tickets in advance but u still have to pick up ticket bought online.

The first day was sunny and beautiful and seeing each piece still there the Parthenon, the Propylaia\\nthe Erechtheion, and The Temple of Athena Nike just to name the most famous. And then imagining all the pieces missing, the sixth Caryatid waiting to come home and join the others in the Acropolis Museum, and The Old Temple which you can see outlines of, but can only imagine what it once looked like. As we were exploring a storm came in and washed us literally off the Acropolis, but it just added to our adventure.\\n\\nOur last day in Greece, we went back in the morning, it was gray and dreary, but we took pictures that turned out to be amazingly beautiful. I am not a photographer but the light appears to have been perfect for the pictures. It actually snowed while we were at the top!

Firstly, the route up from the stop of the hop on hop off bus is not signed at all and isn\\'t easy to find without having to double back on yourself. We also thought it ironic that the disabled elevator seems itself to be poorly signed and up a considerable climb (unless we missed something).\\n\\nThere are around a dozen separate parts to the site and it would seem tailor made for an audioguide. There isn\\'t one though and you have to make do with the static signs (in english and greek). A good suggestion on here was to download an \\'unofficial\\' one beforehand but there really should be their own one, as seen after all at the Panathenaic stadium for example.

We utilized one of the side entrances though, so with only about 10 parties ahead of us, the line moved rather quickly. Once we entered & made our way around to the main entrance, we were met by hordes of people pushing their way up the steps. With our Rick Steves guide book in tow, we decided to take on the monument without a tour guide. (& I’m glad we went this route as being in a tour group just looked like a hassle.) We found it fairly easy to navigate around, & while there were informative plaques throughout, we opted for the descriptions in our book instead. The massive crane inside the main structure was an unfortunate eyesore, but I believe they are currently working on a preservation/restoration project. The views of the city were spectacular though. The ground was very uneven throughout & even slippery in some places, so be sure to wear appropriate shoes. I’d also recommend bringing water & patience as it warms up early in the morning & the number of clueless tourists is absurd.\\nShow less\\nDate of experience: May 2019\\nSee all 9 reviews by aclayr for Athens\\nAsk aclayr about Acropolis\\nThank aclayr\\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\\nDaveKapolei_Hawaii\\nKapolei, Hawaii\\n8624\\nReviewed 5 weeks ago\\nvia mobile\\nThe birthplace of western civilization\\nWhen you consider that you are at the birthplace of western civilization, a few steps are not that great of a sacrifice.
